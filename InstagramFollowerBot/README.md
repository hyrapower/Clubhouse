* Instagram API - Auto Alerts for new subscribers - https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/getting-started

Right now I have no idea what I'm doing. So this is a temp file.

Flesh this out as you develop this app for hardlydoinit.

## Bot Intention

This bot is to connect to the instagram API and allow the user to login, set a watcher on their subscribers, and then notify streamlabs obs using the utility. I have been thinking about setting it up as a local app first and if it can't be integrated directly with streamlabs obs then add it as a source to the program later. This is still a half baked idea so on the off chance that someone is reading this, I still need to figure out if it's possible.
